# Synchronous-First-in-First-Out-FIFO-memory-module
– A synchronous FIFO was designed where data can be stored and retrieved from a memory array in a synchronized
fashion, using a clock signal to coordinate read and write operations.
– Utilized sequential read/write pointers to maintain proper FIFO operation, effectively managing data flow and
synchronization within each clock cycle.
– This approach ensured smooth and continuous data processing, preventing underflow and overflow conditions.
